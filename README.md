# flightcontrol
A basic outline for an Arduino-based flight controller for a model rocket.

An Arduino-based flight control module for large model rockets. Uses the Adafruit 10DOF combined sensor breakout driving four servo-mounted winglets to maintain roll-free vertical flight.

This sketch is targeted at the Teensy 3.2 device.
